* advantages of excel over database
** easy for him
** he can easily create a dropdown himself
** he can use his helper functions to easily view specific events at will
* advantages of database over excel
** more predictable in thesystem
** easy to ensure data integrity, of something happens such as a connection problem right when the user registers 
** we have to ask him, if he changes tae category all tae time
*** if sometimes this might be more ticky than usual
** if the above is true, this means we either:
*** create a specific "data entry" form just for him
*** he retains the Excel workfow, and i have to think of uploading it to database
* we have to read on this:
** https://trumpexcel.com/extract-data-from-drop-down-list/

* Video:
** All the processes from the video
** Show wrongly uploading a video
** Test if the same file is uploaded
** Its simple, 2 types of uploads MCF file, if youre afraid of over-writing anything, use insert. If not, use update. It overwrites based on MCF ID, nothing else.
** Theres only FRL inserts, becoz FRL are "updates" in nature. (subservient/dependent on existing MCF record).
** Registering for an event
** Show removing events registered
** Showing logging in
** Showing dropdown download
** 
** Searching members of a single event is doable but not implemented
